Hi, I'm Kevin, a Research Scientist at Facebook. 
I'm a recent graduate from Duke University, where I completed my PhD while advised by [Lawrence Carin](http://people.ee.duke.edu/~lcarin/). 
My research interests are primarily in deep learning, particularly computer vision, continual learning, federated learning, and adversarial attacks. 
During my PhD, I interned at Google Cloud AI (2017), [Infinia ML](https://infiniaml.com/) (2018), and Facebook (2019). 
I also co-taught a number of machine learning courses at Duke, including the Duke Introduction to Machine Learning [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-duke), four [Duke Machine Learning Schools](https://github.com/duke-mlss), and numerous [+Data Science](https://plus.datascience.duke.edu/) In-Person Learning Experiences.

Before graduate school, I was also at Duke, earning my BSE in 2015 while double majoring in Electrical & Computer Engineering and Biomedical Engineering. 
As an undergraduate, I was able to work on image processing with [Guillermo Sapiro](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/guillermo-sapiro) and brain-computer interfaces with [Leslie Collins](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/leslie-collins).
Outside of research, I was a member of [Sabrosura](http://dukesabrosura.weebly.com/), Duke's premier Latin dance troupe, and enjoyed playing Ultimate frisbee.
